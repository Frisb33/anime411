***Project description: 

Our website, Anime411 will be a Mini-Database with an anime theme. It will allow users to see the information of their desired anime. For example, when someone clicks on the thumbnail of an anime (ex. Naruto), it will transit to another page that has the anime's information: the author, characters' name, character's background, and description




***Functional requirements:

*Anime, split into and is able to be navigated using categories called tags.

*A user database, to store bookmarks and anime progress.

*The name of the anime should be hyperlinked to the page with more details

*Hovering around the name should give a mini pop-out that shows the thumbnail and a part of the sypnosis

*A page should include a list of future upcoming animes

*Updated animes in the home page should be listed alphabetically .

*A search bar should be included to navigate through the number of animes

*A star rating system to rate the anime
